# emochild
EmoChild is a modern resurrection of the classic Tamagotchi (1996 digital pet), brought back with a new purpose:  you don’t feed it, clean it, or keep it alive. Instead, your creature grows every time you emotionally regulate, express, validate, or process a feeling. It’s a digital companion designed to mirror your emotional life.

## Kiro Features Used (Vibe Coding, Specs, Hooks)

This project is being developed using **Kiro Specs**, a structured approach to building features:

**Version 1 (emochild):**
- **Requirements Document** (`.kiro/specs/emochild/requirements.md`): Defines 10 user stories with acceptance criteria
- **Design Document** (`.kiro/specs/emochild/design.md`): Specifies architecture, components, and 12 correctness properties for property-based testing
- **Tasks Document** (`.kiro/specs/emochild/tasks.md`): Breaks implementation into 20 incremental tasks

**Version 2 (emochild-v2):**
- **Requirements Document** (`.kiro/specs/emochild-v2/requirements.md`): Extends with 8 new user stories for landing page, customization, quick emotions, text colors, and micro-sentences
- **Design Document** (`.kiro/specs/emochild-v2/design.md`): Adds 20 new correctness properties for enhanced features
- **Tasks Document** (`.kiro/specs/emochild-v2/tasks.md`): Breaks v2 implementation into 26 incremental tasks

The spec-driven approach ensures:
- Clear requirements traceability
- Property-based testing aligned with design properties
- Incremental development with checkpoints
- Comprehensive test coverage from the start

## Technology Stack
