# emochild
EmoChild is a modern resurrection of the classic Tamagotchi (1996 digital pet), brought back with a new purpose:  you don’t feed it, clean it, or keep it alive. Instead, your creature grows every time you emotionally regulate, express, validate, or process a feeling. It’s a digital companion designed to mirror your emotional life.
