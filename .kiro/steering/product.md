# Product Overview

EmoChild is a modern digital pet inspired by the classic Tamagotchi (1996), reimagined for emotional wellness.

## Core Concept

Unlike traditional virtual pets that require feeding and cleaning, EmoChild grows when the user:
- Emotionally regulates
- Expresses feelings
- Validates emotions
- Processes emotional experiences

The creature serves as a digital companion that mirrors the user's emotional life, encouraging healthy emotional practices through gamification.
