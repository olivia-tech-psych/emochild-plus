# Technology Stack

## Current Status

This is an early-stage project. The tech stack has not yet been established.

## Recommendations for Future Development

When implementing, consider:
- Cross-platform mobile framework (React Native, Flutter, or native iOS/Android)
- Local-first data storage for privacy-sensitive emotional data
- Simple, accessible UI/UX appropriate for emotional wellness context
- Offline-first architecture since emotional check-ins may happen anywhere

## Common Commands

To be defined once build system is established.
